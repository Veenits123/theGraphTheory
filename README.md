The history of graph theory may be specifically traced to 1735, when the Swiss mathematician Leonhard Euler solved the [KÃ¶nigsberg bridge problem](https://www.britannica.com/science/Konigsberg-bridge-problem).

Graph theory, branch of mathematics concerned with networks of points connected by lines. The subject of graph theory had its beginnings in recreational math problems, but it has grown into a significant area of mathematical research, with applications in chemistry, operations research, social sciences, and computer science.
